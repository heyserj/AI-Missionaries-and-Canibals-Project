# AI-Missionaries-and-Canibals-Project

This project assumes that three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a crocodile-infested river, along with a boat that can 
hold one or two people. The program finds a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place 
outnumbered by the cannibals on that side of the river. (Thus, this project solves the traditional Missionaries and Cannibals problem.)

To solve the above problem, I used a blind (uninformed) search technique, as my solution-seeking program can use both depth-first search (DFS) 
and breadth-first search (BFS) to generate a solution(s). All of the code for this project is written in Scheme.
